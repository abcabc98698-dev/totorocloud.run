# Grimorio

A fast, bilingual blog theme for Astro, built for writing of any kind: guides, notes, essays, or a dev log. English and Spanish out of the box, light/dark themes, full-text search, and social images generated at build time. No client-side framework runs the page: Vue powers only the few interactive islands, everything else ships as static HTML.

**[Live demo](https://grimorio-astro.pages.dev)** · built with [Astro](https://astro.build), [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

> Grimorio ships with example posts and copy so you can see every feature working. Replace them with your own — see [Make it yours](#make-it-yours).

## Features

- **Bilingual.** English at `/`, Spanish at `/es/`, with a language switch that keeps you on the same page. Change the default or add/drop a language from one config file.
- **Writing-first.** Markdown posts with categories, tags, a monthly archive, and pagination. Pair a post across languages by giving both files the same name.
- **Search.** Client-side full-text search over every post, opened with `Ctrl` / `⌘ + K`.
- **Light and dark.** Theme toggle that respects the system preference and `prefers-reduced-motion`, with no flash on load.
- **Generated images.** Each post gets a 1200×630 social card and a wide hero banner rendered from its title and category at build time — no design work per post. Drop an image in `src/assets/banners/` to override the banner for a specific post.
- **SEO without the busywork.** Per-page canonical URLs, `hreflang`, Open Graph and Twitter tags, JSON-LD structured data, a `sitemap.xml` with real `lastmod` dates, per-language RSS, `robots.txt`, and an `llms.txt` summary for AI crawlers.
- **Fast by default.** Static output, inlined critical CSS, hover prefetching, and self-hosted fonts. A clean build scores 100 across the board in Lighthouse.
- **Tested.** A Playwright suite covers navigation, search, theming, i18n, and metadata on both desktop and mobile viewports.

## Make it yours

Everything you'll normally touch lives in a handful of files:

| What                        | Where                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Site name, author, nav, links | `src/site.config.json`                                 |
| All interface text          | `src/i18n/es.json`, `src/i18n/en.json`                   |
| Avatar                      | `src/assets/avatar.jpg` (optimized WebP is generated)    |
| Theme colors                | `src/styles/global.css` (`:root` and `:root.dark`)       |
| Posts                       | `src/content/posts/es/`, `src/content/posts/en/`         |
| Projects page               | `src/data/projects.ts`                                   |
| Production domain           | `SITE_URL` in `.env` (see `.env.example`)                |

After cloning, delete the example posts in `src/content/posts/` and the favicons in `public/` you want to replace, then set your domain so the canonical URLs, feeds, sitemap, and social images point at the right place.

### Writing a post

Create `src/content/posts/<lang>/<slug>.md`. Use the **same slug** in `es/` and `en/` so the language switch links the two versions.

```yaml
---
title: "My post"
description: "One or two sentences. Used for SEO and the social card."
date: 2026-09-20
lang: en # must match the folder
category: notes # guides | notes | stories
tags: ["Guides", "Astro"]
featured: false # featured posts are highlighted on the home page
draft: false # drafts are excluded from the build
updated: 2026-10-01 # optional: last-reviewed date, used in the sitemap
---
```

The body is standard Markdown: headings, tables, fenced code (with a copy button and syntax highlighting), blockquotes, and images all work. For diagrams, drop an SVG in `public/` and reference it with a `<figure class="diagram">`.

### Renaming categories

The three example categories are `guides`, `notes`, and `stories`. To change them, edit the list in `src/data/post-options.ts`, the enum in `src/content.config.ts`, and the `category.*` labels in both `src/i18n/*.json`.

### Changing languages

Languages are declared in `src/i18n/index.ts` (`languages` and `defaultLanguage`). To run the site in a single language, keep one entry; to swap the default, change `defaultLanguage`. Keep the sitemap locales in `astro.config.mjs` in sync.

## Deployment

The site is fully static — any host that serves a folder works (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, a plain bucket). Set `SITE_URL` to your production origin before building so metadata is correct.

### Cloudflare Pages

1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. In Cloudflare: **Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Connect to Git** and pick the repo.
3. Build settings:

   | Field                  | Value        |
   | ---------------------- | ------------ |
   | Framework preset       | Astro        |
   | Build command          | `pnpm build` |
   | Build output directory | `dist`       |

4. Add `SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com` under **Settings → Environment variables**, then add your domain under **Custom domains**.

Cloudflare reads the Node version from `.node-version` and pnpm from `package.json`. Every push to `main` ships a new version.

## Submitting to Astro Themes

Grimorio is ready to list on [astro.build/themes](https://astro.build/themes). Before you submit:

1. Deploy it somewhere public and put that URL in the README and in `package.json` (`homepage`).
2. Add a preview screenshot to the repo (a `1200×630` image works well).
3. Make sure the repo is public and keeps the `LICENSE` file.
4. Submit through the form linked at the top of [astro.build/themes](https://astro.build/themes).
